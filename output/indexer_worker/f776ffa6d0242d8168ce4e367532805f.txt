IslamicFinder provides you with the most accurate Islamic Date Converter to facilitate you in your day-to-day planning. You can easily look up the dates of any upcoming Islamic holidays and plan ahead. With just a few clicks, with the Hijri Date Converter, you can convert dates from Hijri to Gregorian and Gregorian to Hijri and sync the Hijri dates with the regular calendar.The Islamic Calendar is based on the Hijri Year. The Hijri Year started when the Prophet (PBUH) migrated from Makkah to Madinah. Hijrah also known as Hejira or Hijra means migration/emigration. The Prophet (PBUH) made the Hijrah as the Muslims were badly persecuted in Mecca and the Muslims had been suffering the atrocities of the Kuffar of Makka for a long time.With the Date Converter, you can view both the Islamic Calendar and the Gregorian Calendar simultaneously and compare the dates of the two at your convenience. Moreover, you can even print out a copy of the Islamic Calendar if you are not comfortable with the digital version.The Date Converter is not only beneficial for Muslims but even non-Muslims living in Muslim countries can benefit from it and get to know about the upcoming holidays well in advance. Moreover, you can even check the Islamic date and year that you were born in. Simply log on to our website and enter your date of birth in the Date Converter and it will churn out your Islamic date of birth along with the Hijri year you were born in!Most of the time, Muslim households do have the latest Islamic Calendars however it is for the month of Ramadan only. So it can be quite frustrating at times when you need to know the Islamic date on an urgent basis and do not have an Islamic Calendar at your disposal. But now you can simply open up the IslamicFinder website and get your hands on the Islamic Calendar of any year and can view and compare the Islamic dates with those of the Gregorian Calendar without any hassle.So if you want to make plans according to the Islamic dates or holidays, you can access the IslamicFinder Date Converter now!
